I completed assignment 1 using the New York State voter list received through a FOIL request to the state board of elections. Data 
were munged and visualized using the rgdal, sp, tidyverse, and ggplot2 packages in R (see the viz.R script included in this repo folder).

Figure 1: Previous 10 years of new voter registrations in New York City show an increase in every borough in the percentage of voters
declining to desginate a party affiliation in their registrations.

Assignment 2 is available on [Authorea](https://www.authorea.com/335252/-uImPv9Gz4PR-HDUssRQcA). The paper implements Rachel Sim's suggestions outlined
[here](https://github.com/ursulakaczmarek/PUI2018_uak211/blob/master/HW4_uak211/CitibikeReview_rms818.md).
